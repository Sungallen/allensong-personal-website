          several events (workshop, club gathering, tech talk etc.) and
          programming courses. In teaching, I like to start with fundamental
          concepts in plain words then apply skills in group project, through
          project based learning, fellows learn how to use what they learned in
          real case, and consolidate the knowledge by debugging and develop
          required features. Aside for programming stuff, I also organized few
          social events and activities to promote the club and attract new
          members.

          Besides, I actively contributed to various club owned projects, I

          I implemented agile development methodologies, enabling our team to

          For me backend development is like a vivid book about what I learned
          from courses. In networking, I have to consider IP addressing, TCP/IP,
          UDP, DNS, and HTTP, according to need.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has strong connection with operating systems, like async, process
          management, threading, memory management, file systems, and . To make
          the server scalable, they are all important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my friends like to joke around backend is really easy, since
          stuff we done on course only about CRUD, and my experience in CSL give
          me chance to design real system and consider more beyond that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently I have extend my backend knowledge to learn MLOps and DevOps,
          as working on deploy model on API and collect data continuously with
          distributed task scheduler such Airflow.

        <p>
          I enjoy frontend a lot, in past I develop in React.js since the team I
          work with it. But recently I start to go with Next.js, since it
          provide more flexibility and better performance and SSR gradually
          become the go to standard in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In styling, I usually work with styled component, usually I got layout
          from Figma, and implement it with styled component. I also use
          TailwindCSS these days, when I am doing my own project or prototype
          that no design layout is provided. I found it super convenient and
          easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          In CityScope project, there are many visualizations relating to urban,
          We usually doing the stack with React.js, Redux-Saga, DeckGL, and
          Mapboxgl to integrate with backend and database.

          I also try 3D rendering before, and there are some difference between
          WebGL and Unity Engine, I more prefer to use Three.js for the the
          convenience of integrating with React.js.
